I'm going to start with my two favoirte friends, Francis and Andrei. We've been together having fun and do crazy stuff since 2016.<br>
There's always a small fights between us but day after a day, we just forget about it and say sorry.<br>
They're always here for me when i'm feeling down and we do the same to each other,<br>
that's why they're my best friends!<br>
